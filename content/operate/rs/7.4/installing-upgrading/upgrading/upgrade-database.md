## Default Redis database versions {#default-db-versions}

When you upgrade an existing database, it uses the latest bundled Redis version unless you specify a different version with the `redis_version` option in the [REST API]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/rest-api/requests/bdbs" >}}) or [`rladmin upgrade db`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/upgrade#upgrade-db" >}}).

Redis Enterprise Software v6.x includes two Redis database versions: 6.0 and 6.2.
As of version 7.2, Redis Enterprise Software includes three Redis database versions.

To view available Redis database versions:

- In the Cluster Manager UI, see **Redis database versions** on the **Cluster > Configuration** screen.

- Send a [`GET /nodes` REST API request]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/rest-api/requests/nodes" >}}) and see `supported_database_versions` in the response.

The default Redis database version differs between Redis Enterprise releases as follows:

| Redis<br />Enterprise | Bundled Redis<br />DB versions | Default DB version<br />(upgraded/new databases) |
|-------|----------|-----|
| 7.4.2 | 6.0, 6.2, 7.2 | 7.2 |
| 7.2.4 | 6.0, 6.2, 7.2 | 7.2 |
| 6.4.2 | 6.0, 6.2 | 6.2 |
| 6.2.x | 6.0, 6.2 | 6.0 |


The upgrade policy is only relevant for Redis Enterprise Software versions 6.2.4 through 6.2.18. For more information about upgrade policies, see the [6.2 version of this document](https://docs.redis.com/6.2/rs/installing-upgrading/upgrading/#redis-upgrade-policy).

## Upgrade prerequisites

Before upgrading a database:

- Review the relevant [release notes](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/release-notes/) for any preparation instructions.

- Verify that the database version meets the minimums specified earlier.

    To determine the database version:

    - Use the Cluster Manager UI to open the **Configuration** tab for the database and select {{< image filename="/images/rs/icons/info-icon.png#no-click" alt="The About database button" width="18px" class="inline" >}} **About**.

    - _(Optional)_ Use the [`rladmin status extra all`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/status" >}}) command to display configuration details:

        ```sh
        rladmin status extra all
        ```
    
        When the database compatibility version is outdated, <nobr>`OLD REDIS VERSION`</nobr> appears in the command output.

- Verify the cluster is fully upgraded and operational.

    Use the Cluster Manager UI to display the **Configuration** tab for the cluster. The tab displays the cluster version information and the Redis database compatibility version.

- Check client compatibility with the database version.

    If you run Redis Stack commands with Go-Redis versions 9 and later or Lettuce versions 6 and later, set the client’s protocol version to RESP2 before upgrading your database to Redis version 7.2 to prevent potential application issues due to RESP3 breaking changes. See [Client prerequisites for Redis 7.2 upgrade]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/compatibility/resp#client-prerequisites-for-redis-72-upgrade" >}}) for more details and examples.

- To avoid data loss during the upgrade, [back up your data]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/databases/import-export/schedule-backups" >}}).  

    You can [export the data]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/databases/import-export/export-data" >}}) to an external location, [enable replication]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/databases/durability-ha/replication" >}}), or [enable persistence]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/databases/configure/database-persistence" >}}).

    When choosing how to back up data, keep the following in mind:

    - To reduce downtime when replication is enabled, a failover is performed before restarting the primary (master) database.

    - When persistence is enabled without replication, the database is unavailable during restart because the data is restored from the persistence file. AOF persistence restoration is slower than snapshot restoration.

## Upgrade database

To upgrade a database:

1.  _(Optional)_  Back up the database to minimize the risk of data loss.

1.  Use [`rladmin`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/upgrade" >}}) to upgrade the database. During the upgrade process, the database will restart without losing any data.

    - To upgrade a database without modules:

        ``` shell
        rladmin upgrade db <database name | database ID>
        ```

        Example of a successful upgrade:

        ``` shell
        rladmin> upgrade db demo
        Monitoring d194c4a3-631c-4726-b799-331b399fc85c
        active - SMUpgradeBDB init
        active - SMUpgradeBDB wait_for_version
        active - SMUpgradeBDB configure_shards
        completed - SMUpgradeBDB
        Done
        ```

    - If the database has modules enabled and new module versions are available in the cluster, run `rladmin upgrade db` with additional parameters to upgrade the module versions when you upgrade the database. See [Upgrade modules]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/install/upgrade-module" >}}) for more details.

    - To upgrade the database to a version other than the default version, use the `redis_version` parameter:

        ```sh
        rladmin upgrade db <database name | database ID> redis_version <version>
        ```

1. Check the Redis database compatibility version for the database to confirm the upgrade.  

    To do so:

    - Use the Cluster Manager UI to open the **Configuration** tab for the database and select {{< image filename="/images/rs/icons/info-icon.png#no-click" alt="The About database button" width="18px" class="inline" >}} **About**.

    - Use [`rladmin status databases extra all`]({{< relref "/operate/rs/7.4/references/cli-utilities/rladmin/status#status-databases" >}}) to display a list of the databases in your cluster and their current Redis database compatibility version:

        ```sh
        rladmin status databases extra all
        ```

    Verify that the Redis version is set to the expected value.
